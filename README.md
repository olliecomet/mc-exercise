Communicate before merging branches. 
Merge branches one at a time. 
Always pull from the origin before making a new branch.

Ted = Ollie

It's important to communicate with one another, to be pushing individually not all at once and to be pulling from master before creating a new branch, preferably at the same time so we're on the same page."
